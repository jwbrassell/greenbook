# Chapter 2: Web Fundamentals

## Introduction

Think about ordering food at a restaurant: you make a request (order), the kitchen processes it, and returns a response (your meal). Web communication works similarly - browsers make requests to servers, which process them and send back responses. In this chapter, we'll explore how the web works, using familiar real-world examples to understand these interactions.

## 1. HTTP Basics

### The Restaurant Metaphor

Think of web communication like a restaurant:
- Browser is like a customer
- Server is like the kitchen
- HTTP request is like placing an order
- HTTP response is like receiving your meal
- Status codes are like order status updates

### Request/Response Cycle

```
Basic Flow:
1. Customer (Browser) makes request
   GET /menu.html HTTP/1.1
   Host: restaurant.com

2. Kitchen (Server) processes request
   - Find menu
   - Prepare response

3. Waiter (Network) delivers response
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: text/html
   
   <html>Menu content here...</html>
```

### HTTP Methods

```
Common Methods:
GET: Like asking to see menu
- Retrieve information
- No side effects
- Can be cached

POST: Like placing order
- Submit new information
- Changes server state
- Shouldn't be cached

PUT: Like updating order
- Replace existing information
- Idempotent (same result if repeated)

DELETE: Like canceling order
- Remove information
- Changes server state
```

### Hands-On Exercise: HTTP Explorer

1. Make basic HTTP requests:
```bash
# GET request
curl -v http://example.com

# POST request
curl -v -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"order": "pizza"}' \
  http://api.example.com/orders

# See headers only
curl -I http://example.com
```

## 2. Web Security

### The Sealed Envelope Metaphor

Think of HTTPS like sending sensitive information:
- HTTP is like a postcard (anyone can read)
- HTTPS is like a sealed envelope
- SSL/TLS is like the envelope's security features
- Certificates are like official seals

### HTTPS Basics

```
Security Features:
1. Encryption
   - Scrambles data in transit
   - Like writing in secret code

2. Authentication
   - Verifies server identity
   - Like checking official ID

3. Integrity
   - Ensures no tampering
   - Like tamper-evident seals
```

### SSL/TLS Certificates

```
Certificate Components:
1. Identity Information
   - Domain name
   - Organization
   - Location

2. Public Key
   - Used for encryption
   - Publicly available

3. Digital Signature
   - From trusted authority
   - Proves authenticity

Like a passport:
- Contains identification
- Has security features
- Issued by trusted authority
```

### Hands-On Exercise: Security Checker

1. Examine website security:
```bash
# Check certificate
openssl s_client -connect google.com:443

# View certificate details
echo | openssl s_client -connect google.com:443 2>/dev/null \
  | openssl x509 -text

# Test SSL/TLS configuration
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 google.com
```

## 3. URL Structure

### The Library Organization Metaphor

Think of URLs like library organization:
- Protocol is like building section
- Domain is like floor number
- Path is like shelf location
- Query parameters are like specific book features

### URL Components

```
https://www.example.com:443/products?category=books&sort=price

Protocol (https://)
└── Like transportation method
    
Domain (www.example.com)
└── Like building address

Port (:443)
└── Like specific entrance

Path (/products)
└── Like aisle number

Query (?category=books&sort=price)
└── Like specific requirements
```

### URL Encoding

```
Special Characters:
Space → %20
& → %26
= → %3D
? → %3F

Like library catalog codes:
"Sci-Fi & Fantasy" becomes:
Sci-Fi%20%26%20Fantasy
```

### Hands-On Exercise: URL Builder

Create URL manipulation tool:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlencode, parse_qs

# Parse URL
url = "https://example.com/search?q=python&type=book"
parsed = urlparse(url)
print(f"Protocol: {parsed.scheme}")
print(f"Domain: {parsed.netloc}")
print(f"Path: {parsed.path}")

# Build query string
params = {
    "category": "programming",
    "level": "beginner",
    "format": "ebook"
}
query = urlencode(params)
print(f"Query: {query}")
```

## Practical Exercises

1. Break down URLs
2. Validate components
3. Handle encoding
4. Build URLs
5. Check security

## Common Questions and Answers

Q: Why do we need different HTTP methods?
A: Different methods clearly indicate the intention of the request, like how different types of forms serve different purposes.

Q: How does HTTPS protect data?
A: It encrypts data in transit and verifies server identity, like sending valuable items in a secure, authenticated courier service.

Q: When should I encode URLs?
A: Encode URLs when they contain special characters or spaces, ensuring they're properly transmitted and interpreted.
