   - rm (remove)
   - Metaphor: Organizing physical documents
   - Visual: File operation flowcharts
   - Exercise: File manipulation tasks

3. Viewing and Editing
   - cat (display file contents)
   - less (page through files)
   - head/tail (view file portions)
   - nano/vim (text editors)
   - Metaphor: Reading and writing in a notebook
   - Visual: Text editor comparison
   - Exercise: File viewing and editing

## Chapter 3: Shell Scripting Basics
### Learning Objectives
- Understand shell script structure
- Learn basic scripting concepts
- Create simple automation scripts

### Key Concepts
1. Script Fundamentals
   - Shebang line
   - Comments
   - Variables
   - Metaphor: Writing a recipe
   - Visual: Script structure diagram
   - Exercise: Create basic scripts

2. Control Structures
   - if statements
   - loops (for, while)
   - case statements
   - Metaphor: Following a decision tree
   - Visual: Control flow diagrams
   - Exercise: Decision-making scripts

3. Input and Output
   - Command line arguments
   - Reading user input
   - Writing output
   - Metaphor: Having a conversation
   - Visual: I/O flow diagram
   - Exercise: Interactive scripts

## Chapter 4: Advanced Shell Concepts
### Learning Objectives
- Master pipe and redirection
- Understand process management
- Learn advanced script techniques

### Key Concepts
1. Pipes and Redirection
   - | (pipe operator)
   - > (output redirection)
   - < (input redirection)
   - Metaphor: Water pipeline system
   - Visual: Data flow diagrams
   - Exercise: Command chaining

2. Process Management
   - ps (process status)
   - top (system monitor)
   - kill (terminate processes)
   - Metaphor: Managing workers in a factory
   - Visual: Process hierarchy
   - Exercise: Process control

3. Advanced Scripting
   - Functions
   - Error handling
   - Script debugging
   - Metaphor: Building with LEGO blocks
   - Visual: Script building blocks
   - Exercise: Complex script creation

## Projects
1. File Organizer
   - Script to organize files by type
   - Reinforces file operations

2. System Monitor
   - Script to monitor system resources
   - Practice with process management

3. Backup Tool
   - Script to backup specified directories
   - Combines multiple concepts

## Assessment
- Command line challenges
- Script writing exercises
- Project implementation
