# Chapter 2: Essential Commands

## Introduction

Think about organizing your desk or cleaning your room. You need to know how to move things around, create new spaces, remove clutter, and find what you need. The terminal gives you these same abilities, but for managing files and folders on your computer. In this chapter, we'll learn the essential commands that let you organize and manage your digital workspace efficiently.

## 1. File System Navigation

### The Library Metaphor

Think of your computer's file system like a large library:
- Main entrance (root directory /)
- Different floors (main directories)
- Different sections (subdirectories)
- Books (files)
- Card catalog (file system)

### Understanding Paths

```
Absolute Paths (from main entrance):
/Users/username/Documents/report.txt

Like giving full address:
123 Main Street, Springfield, IL, USA

Relative Paths (from current location):
../Documents/report.txt

Like giving directions from current spot:
"Two blocks north, then right"
```

### Essential Navigation Commands

```
1. Print Working Directory
pwd
Shows current location

2. List Directory Contents
ls                  (Basic list)
ls -l               (Detailed list)
ls -a               (Show hidden files)
ls -la              (Detailed + hidden)
ls Documents        (List specific directory)

3. Change Directory
cd Documents        (Go to Documents)
cd ..              (Go up one level)
cd ~               (Go to home)
cd /               (Go to root)
cd ../Documents    (Go up, then to Documents)
```

### Hands-On Exercise: Path Navigator

1. Create this directory structure:
```
practice/
├── documents/
│   ├── work/
│   └── personal/
└── photos/
    ├── vacation/
    └── family/
```

2. Practice navigation:
- Start in practice/
- Move to documents/work/
- Go back to practice/
- Move to photos/vacation/
- Return to home directory

## 2. File Operations

### The Office Filing Metaphor

Think of file operations like organizing an office:
- Creating new folders (mkdir)
- Creating new documents (touch)
- Moving files (mv)
- Copying files (cp)
- Removing files (rm)

### Creating Files and Directories

```
1. Create Directory
mkdir projects
mkdir -p projects/web/css    (-p creates parent dirs)

Like creating:
- New filing cabinet (projects)
- With specific drawers (web/css)

2. Create Empty File
touch note.txt
touch index.html style.css

Like creating:
- Blank piece of paper
- Multiple blank pages
```

### Copying and Moving

```
1. Copy Files
cp source.txt destination.txt
cp file.txt backup/
cp -r folder backup/          (-r for directories)

Like:
- Making photocopies
- Filing copies in different locations

2. Move/Rename Files
mv old.txt new.txt           (Rename)
mv file.txt documents/       (Move)
mv folder newname            (Rename directory)

Like:
- Relabeling folders
- Moving files to new cabinet
```

### Removing Files and Directories

```
CAUTION: Removed files can't be recovered!

1. Remove Files
rm file.txt
rm -i file.txt              (-i asks for confirmation)

2. Remove Directories
rm -r directory             (Remove directory and contents)
rm -ri directory           (-i asks for each file)

Like:
- Shredding documents (no recovery!)
- Clearing out filing cabinets
```

### Hands-On Exercise: File Operations

Create a practice area:
1. Make project structure:
```
mkdir -p project/{docs,src,tests}
cd project
```

2. Practice operations:
```
touch src/main.txt
cp src/main.txt docs/
mv docs/main.txt docs/readme.txt
rm src/main.txt
```

## 3. Viewing and Editing Files

### The Reading Room Metaphor

Different ways to view files:
- cat: Like reading straight through
- less: Like reading with page turns
- head/tail: Like reading start/end
- nano/vim: Like editing with pencil

### Viewing File Contents

```
1. Display Entire File
cat file.txt
cat -n file.txt             (-n adds line numbers)

2. Page Through File
less file.txt
    Space: Next page
    b: Previous page
    q: Quit
    /: Search
    n: Next search result

3. View Parts of File
head file.txt               (First 10 lines)
head -n 5 file.txt         (First 5 lines)
tail file.txt              (Last 10 lines)
tail -f log.txt            (Watch file updates)
```

### Basic Text Editors

```
1. Nano (Beginner-Friendly)
nano file.txt
    Ctrl + O: Save
    Ctrl + X: Exit
    Ctrl + K: Cut line
    Ctrl + U: Paste line

2. Vim (Advanced)
vim file.txt
    i: Enter insert mode
    Esc: Exit insert mode
    :w: Save
    :q: Quit
    :wq: Save and quit
```

### Hands-On Exercise: File Editing

1. Create and edit files:
```
touch notes.txt
nano notes.txt
# Add some text
# Save and exit
```

2. View file different ways:
```
cat notes.txt
less notes.txt
head notes.txt
tail notes.txt
```

## Common Questions and Answers

Q: What if I accidentally delete something important?
A: Always use -i flag with rm for confirmation, and maintain backups of important files.

Q: When should I use absolute vs relative paths?
A: Use absolute paths in scripts for reliability, relative paths for quick navigation.

Q: Do I need to learn vim?
A: Start with nano for basic editing. Learn vim when you're comfortable with the terminal.
